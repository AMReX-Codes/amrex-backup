Welcome to AMReX's documentation
================================

AMReX is a software framework library containing all the functionality to write
massively parallel, block-structured adaptive mesh refinement (AMR)
applications. AMReX is freely available `on Github
<https://github.com/AMReX-Codes/amrex>`_.

AMReX is developed at LBNL, NREL, and ANL as part of the Block-Structured AMR
Co-Design Center in DOE's Exascale Computing Project. 

All of AMReX's development is done in the github repository under the
development branch; anyone can see the latest updates. Changes are merged into
the master branch at the beginning of each month.

We are always happy to have users contribute to the AMReX source code. To
contribute, issue a pull request against the development branch (details `here
<https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/>`_).  Any level of
changes are welcomed: documentation, bug fixes, new test problems, new solvers,
etc...

To obtain help, simply post an `issue
<https://github.com/AMReX-Codes/amrex/issues>`_
on the AMReX GitHub webpage.

Besides this documentation, there is API documentation generated by `Doxygen
<https://amrex-codes.github.io/amrex/doxygen>`_.

Documentation on migration from BoxLib is available in the AMReX repository at Docs/Migration.
